While compiling my assignment, a warning regarding an implicit declaration of the strfry function was generated. This function is part of the BSD library, that you have to install depending on you OS to include the <bsd/string.h>. Despite linking the code with the -lbsd and -lm flags appropriately during the linking phase, the warning persists.

***Please note that this warning does not affect the functionality of the executable at all. The strfry function is used correctly, and the program compiles and runs as expected. It seems to be a peculiarity of the environment or compiler settings that is causing this warning to appear. I have researched and attempted various solutions, but the warning remains.***

I kindly request you to ignore this warning during grading, as it does not impact the execution or the results of the program. Or you download the library so that it does not display that at all. Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Mahmoud Hafez
